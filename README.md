# CheckUp! Android App
## By Ashley Maceli - Epicodus 2016

## Description

CheckUp is a new kind of health tracking app. Still in development as an ongoing independent project for the Android course at Epicodus. Keep track of your important health questions and concerns. Add those to your scheduled appointments and refer to it during your appointment.

Check Up wants to help keep these records organized and available for you to make the most of your appointments!
